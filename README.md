# SOA-AngularJS-REST-API

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Briefing
This is an amazing AngularJS architecture example, all the modules are separated and all of their files are included only on the module itself.
I made this to improve scalability, maintenance and development for teams of a lot of people working over different areas of the product.
So far it works perfect.

Also, it is a Service Oriented Architecture. All data is retrieved from a REST Api. I consider this like a good piece work and I feel very proud of it.
